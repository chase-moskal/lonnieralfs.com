When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.

If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You can spend all day playing with mountains. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Working it up and down, back and forth.
