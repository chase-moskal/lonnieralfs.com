				<h2>Athena</h2>
				<p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
				<p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You can spend all day playing with mountains. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Working it up and down, back and forth.</p>

				<h2>Sobek the Egyptian Crocodile God</h2>
				<p>Andrew came to me with his vision of an Egyptian God, Sobek, who is half-man and half-crocodile! It was really fun making his scaley skin, his Egyptian armor, and giving him a "coming at you" kind of pose</p>
				<p>I came up with the idea to use a real hieroglyph, "Ankh", which means "eternal life". Andrew liked it, so we put it in Sobek's neckpiece. We added a few more too</p>
				<p>This is for a game Andrew is working on called "Godlike", check it out!</p>

				<h2>Hire Lonnie to make your mini</h2>
				<p>Let's make the character of your imagination into something real, that you can hold in your hands!</p>
				<p>I currently work for $40/hour, and I work fast, so minis cost my clients between $600 to $1200 depending on the unique level of complexity of each mini</p>
				<p>I'm Canadian, so those are Canadian dollars</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
							<p><strong>Email me about the character</strong></p>
							<p>Tell me from the heart, a detailed description of what you desire</p>
							<p>What size, and shape, and pose</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>I'll send you an estimate</strong></p>
						<p>I'll tell you how long it should take and how much it will cost you, and when it can fit into my schedule</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>You pay 50% via paypal</strong></p>
						<p>Gotta grease these wheels</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>I make your mini a reality!</strong></p>
						<p>During the week we've scheduled to work on the mini, we'll be in touch about the progress so we can make tweaks along the way</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>We finalize the mini, and you pay the remaining balance</strong></p>
						<p></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>I'll courier the 3d printed mini straight to your door!</strong></p>
						<p>I'll also email you all of the 3D files and rendered images</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:lonnieralfs@gmail.com">lonnieralfs@gmail.com</a> and let's start talking about your mini!</p>
