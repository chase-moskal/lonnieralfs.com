				<h2>Athena</h2>
				<p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
				<p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You can spend all day playing with mountains. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Working it up and down, back and forth.</p>

				<h2>Sobek the Egyptian Crocodile God</h2>
				<p>Andrew came to me with his vision of an Egyptian God, Sobek, who is half-man and half-crocodile! It was really fun making his scaley skin, his Egyptian armor, and giving him a "coming at you" kind of pose</p>
				<p>I came up with the idea to use a real hieroglyph, "Ankh", which means "eternal life". Andrew liked it, so we put it in Sobek's neckpiece. We added a few more too</p>
				<p>This is for a game Andrew is working on called "Godlike", check it out!</p>
